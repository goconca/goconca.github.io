Title: Come speak at a GoCon Canada 2019

> Alone, we can do so little; together, we can do so much

> -Helen Keller

The Go programming language marked its ninth anniversary in 2018 since it was [first publicly announced](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2009/11/hey-ho-lets-go.html). Both the language and the community took off  ðŸ›«, with no signs of slowing down. 

Check out [Nine years of Go](https://blog.golang.org/9years) for a brief reflection .. incredible, right?!

Whether you're a newcomer, part of the core team, or a long time enthusiast, there is a role we all play to foster a community that welcomes new ideas _and people_ in this complex and crazy field.

GoCon Canada would like to do its part in helping all feel welcome and build a sense of community.

In this post,

- touch on a few reasons *potential* speakers don't submit proposals
- provide [resources from the web](#resources-from-the-web) that folks might find useful as it relates to conference proposals and speaking

### Not submitting a proposal because..

#### I'm not an expert

And guess what?! That's exactly why _you_, yes _you_, should be submitting a proposal.

Some incredible talks have been given by folks who told a story of their pitfalls and their journey towards a potential solution. They were not experts, but storytellers.

These talks not only benefit others who may be facing similar challenges, but also enable the greater community, language and package maintainers to get a sense of issues faced by others.

- Did we make the API too complex? Are there not enough examples?
- Should we add documentation, update the FAQ? 
- Should we follow up on the user report with a blog post or short video?

At GoCon Canada we'd like to encourage participation from non-experts, because for the Go community to be more than the sum of its parts, each part must make an effort to understand the whole.

You do not need to be an expert to give a conference talk!

#### I'm not good at public speaking

It's scary. It's nerve-racking. Jitters and butterflies. You start talking, the only voice in the room is yours, mind starts racing and all attention is on you.

Let's stop there, and take a few steps back.

It is inevitable _most of us_ will experience such emotions prior to public speaking. But the good news is that feeling can be mitigated to an extent.

At a recent [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/alex_honnold_how_i_climbed_a_3_000_foot_vertical_cliff_without_ropes?language=en) the famous rock climber, Alex Honnold, describes how he mentally prepared for a 3,000-foot vertical ascent of El Capitan. What's the big deal? He did it with no harness; just climbing shoes, a t-shirt and a chalk bag.

The take away from his success is the result of tremendous _preparation ahead of time_.

So what does this have to do with anything? You too can overcome that initial hurdle of public speaking by being well prepared.

> Practice.

> > Rehearse. 
> >
> > > Rinse. 
> > >
> > > > Repeat. 

Very few of us go up on stage and "wing it". We practice in front of the mirror, co-workers, family, friends, etc. Over and over.

If you know your talk and practiced it ahead of time, when you go up on stage there will be a sense of confidence delivering your talk. It will give you the strength to overcome those initial butterflies and jitters. 

Just remember, you have a story to tell, an experience to share, and folks are _genuinely_ interested in what you have to say.
