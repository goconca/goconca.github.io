title: GoCon Canada, but why?! And who?
date: "2019-03-03"

Since the inception of GoCon Canada a lot of folks, including potential attendees and sponsors, reached out with questions about the event and the organizers. So we thought we'd answer these and a few others.

We will elaborate, but the short answer to the "why?!" can be answered with a tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It‚Äôs been said to me by several people now that I ‚Äúpush‚Äù <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/golang?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#golang</a> so much that they thought I worked in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DevRel?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DevRel</a> for Google. <br><br>I don‚Äôt, friends. I‚Äôm just a developer who loves working with a technology and wants to share that passion with those with whom I interact.</p>&mdash; Johnny Boursiquot (@jboursiquot) <a href="https://twitter.com/jboursiquot/status/1086681603319967744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2019</a></blockquote>

Much like Johnny, we're a small group of enthusiastic developers and a designer who like a particular technology. The Go progamming language promised to "make us love programming again" and we could not agree more!

Not only is Go a solid piece of tech to have in your toolbox, but there is a wonderful community and ecosystem surrounding it. Folks who do Go are typically referred to as "Gophers" and are found all over the globe.

There have been dozens of Go Conferences including, but not limited to, Denver, New York, Seattle, Tokyo, Israel, Russia, Iceland, UK, Brazil, China, India, Belgium, France, Italy .. and the list goes on. Likewise, there are more than [300 Go-related meetups](https://www.meetup.com/topics/golang/) all over the world. See the 2018 [Nine years of Go](https://blog.golang.org/9years) blog for a summary of the past year.

<div class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold is-size-5">
So, given we like Go (a lot) and the community (a lot), it felt natural to put together a GO-specific conference in Toronto, Canda üá®üá¶.

##### Q:	Who is behind GoCon Canada?

A:	[Dylan](https://dylanarbour.com/), [Zach](https://zachgoldstein.github.io/), [Lubov](https://www.lubovsoltan.com/), [Max](https://gonzih.me/) and [Mike](https://mfridman.com). A small group of enthusiatic volunteers.

We registered a **non-profit** organization called **GoCon Community Group** with the intention of:

> a. holding conferences, workshops and community events;
>
> b. providing a forum for the discussion of technology including but not limited to the Go programming language

We truly hope our efforts will bring together current members of the community and attract newcomers alike. This will be a welcoming, open and inclusive environment for **all**. Please see our [code of conduct](https://gocon.ca/code-of-conduct/) and that of the broader [Go Community](https://golang.org/conduct).

##### Q:	Is it normal to accept sponsorship money as a non-profit?

A:	Yes. So long as that money is used to achieve the objectives of the non-profit organization.

Being a small group of individuals, we simply do not have funds to host an event solely funded by ticket sales, especially in Toronto.

Furthermore, there are many awesome companies that adopted or are thinking of adopting Go within their stack. These companies enable Gophers to do what they love and pay them for it.

We believe communities are built alongside such companies. It is an opportunity for both sides to discover each other within the Go ecosystem.

At the time of this writing the following companies have sponsored us, and we are really grateful for their contributions.

##### Q:	Why was the CFP open for sooooooo long?

Sometimes potential speakers do not know their schedule or availability many months out. We kept the CFP open for ~4 months to enable speakers with varying obligations to submit a talk.

The CFP closes March 18 and we'd like to have most, if not all, talks selected and published within 2 weeks (early April). This should provide ~2 month buffer for speakers.

##### Q:	Why just a single day event?

1. We did not have the funds to secure a multi-day venue.
2. We'd like to gauge the overall interest and understand how best this event can give back to the community.

For the future, we are thinking the following:

> 2-day event: full day workshop + one day (single or two tracks in parallel, to be determined)

##### Q:	Do you accept money in exchange for sponsored talks?

No. We will not be accepting $$ in exchange for speaker slots.

This is a community event, not a marketing campaign. We hope all talks will be pure and in the spirit of benefiting the community.
